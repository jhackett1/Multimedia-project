      <p>The movement of people on a stage has the potential to transport us to other places, other worlds, other lives. But more so than many artforms, the theatre has a reputation for inaccessibility.</p>

      <p>With tickets for the biggest productions costing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/london-theatre-tickets-among-the-worlds-most-expensive-as-shows-increasingly-charge-100-a-seat-a6689246.html" target="blank">upwards of £60 per person</a>, is the theatre only for the rich? Can it ever be for the many?

      <p>Here in Sheffield, we boast one of the most financially successful theatre complexes outside London. The Crucible, Lyceum and Studio are the core of a theatrical community that also comprises many lesser-known gems. This is despite some of the most deprived communities in the country sitting within our seven hills.</p>

      <p>How do we reconcile these facts?</p>

      <figcaption>Sheffield has no shortage of well-known venues, along with a number of smaller gems.</figcaption>

      <p>Despite the funding cuts marauding their way across the arts sector, Sheffield Theatres' chief executive Dan Bates is proud with the number and breadth of performances that make it onto the three stages under his remit, saying; "We are a big complex, we produce a huge amount of work, we programme a lot of work in the Lyceum especially. Our huge loyal audience who support us throughout the year are really the ones we have to thank."</p>

      <p>Slung Low is not a normal theatre company. Based in the HUBs, <a href="http://www.visitleeds.co.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=3&venue=1820380" target="blank">a haphazard space built underneath five railway arches</a> on the wrong side of Leeds, they put on monthly pay-what-you-like performances. Artistic director Alan Lane explains the unusual policy thus; "Theatre should be easy to go to, and exciting, and yet people don’t think that it is, so we must be doing something wrong."</p>

      <p>"One of the ways we can start to address the problem is to say to people “you can pay what you decide on the way out” – the audience can place their own value on the experience. They’re given a purpose and a function; they’re more than just customers.</p>

      <p>Slung Low brought this democratic ethos to the Crucible in 2015, when they were invited to produce something very special: <i>Camelot: The Shining City</i>. The production was not only staged in Sheffield, but <i>set</i> here. At the climax of the first act, the fictional version of the Crucible we buy into is set alight, and actors dressed in the garb of theatre ushers whisk you outside into the Tudor Square dusk.</p>



      <p>Sheffield also has a healthy relationship with student theatre of all stripes. The resident performing arts companies at the University of Sheffield,</p>

      <p>Theatre can have a substantial connection with the communities surrounding it. It is not all tried-and-tested stories, enjoyed only by the elite in society and children in English Literature classes. Peoples' theatres and alternative venues are overturning the old stereotypes; creating a mass democratisation of the theatre.</p>
