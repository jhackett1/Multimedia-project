      <p>The movement of people on a stage has the potential to transport us to other places, other worlds, other lives. But more so than many artforms, the theatre has a reputation for inaccessibility.</p>

      <h3><div></div> I: Complication</h3>

      <p>With Arts Council funding on the decline (1.6% over the last five years, even before accounting for inflation), theatre companies are searching for new ways to fill seats. Many have climbed on the bandwagon of tacking on well-known celebrity faces to casts, a trend epitomised with Benedict Cumberbatch’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/29/benedict-cumberbatch-hamlet-olivier-awards-nominations" target="blank">recent tour as Hamlet</a> at the Barbican. But these performances price out all but a lucky few.</p>

        <figcaption>The shape of the problem.</i></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>With tickets for the biggest productions costing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/london-theatre-tickets-among-the-worlds-most-expensive-as-shows-increasingly-charge-100-a-seat-a6689246.html" target="blank">upwards of £90 per person</a>, is the theatre only for the rich? Can it ever be for the many?</p>

      <p>Here in Sheffield, we boast one of the most financially successful theatre complexes outside London. The Crucible, Lyceum and Studio are the core of a theatrical community that also includes many lesser-known gems. This is despite some of the most deprived communities in the country sitting within our seven hills.</p>

      <p>How do we reconcile these opposites?</p>

      <!-- <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zFvvbVElsVI4.k1uwYJ1RTGNw" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>
      <figcaption>Sheffield has no shortage of well-known venues, along with a number of smaller gems.</figcaption> -->

      <p>Despite the funding cuts marauding their way across the arts sector, Sheffield Theatres' chief executive Dan Bates is proud with the number and breadth of performances that make it onto the three stages under his remit, saying; "We are a big complex producing a huge amount of work. Our huge loyal audience who support us throughout the year are really the ones we have to thank."</p>

      <h3><div></div> II: Exploration</h3>

      <p>Slung Low is not a normal theatre company. Based in the HUBs, <a href="http://www.visitleeds.co.uk/thedms.aspx?dms=3&venue=1820380" target="blank">a haphazard space built underneath five railway arches</a> on the wrong side of Leeds, they put on monthly pay-what-you-like performances. Artistic director Alan Lane explains the unusual policy thus; "Theatre should be easy to go to, and exciting, and yet people don’t think that it is, so we must be doing something wrong."</p>

      </figure>

      <p>"One of the ways we can start to address the problem is to say to people “you can pay what you decide on the way out” – the audience can place their own value on the experience. They’re given a purpose and a function; they’re more than just customers.</p>

      <p>The egalitarian spirit extends to their own staff. Directors and caretakers alike earn the same flat £95 per day.</p>

      <p>Slung Low brought this democratic ethos to the Crucible in 2015, when they were invited to produce something very special: <i>Camelot: The Shining City</i>. Conceived as “the city telling a story to itself”, it took immersive theatre to heart, involving the audience in every part of the performance.</p>

      <p>At the climax of the first act, the fictional version of the Crucible we’ve been inhabiting is set alight by the villains. Actors dressed in the garb of theatre ushers whisk us outside into the dusk of Tudor Square and young people drawn from schools and colleges around the city enact the beginning of a popular uprising.</p>

      <p>At one stage, secret police “apprehend” audience members, seemingly at random. Despite being held together by only one or two professional actors, and with a ticket price of a mere £10 per person, it's an accessible, emotionally draining experience that few can be unaffected by.</p>

      <p>But original theatre can be found everywhere, not just on the city's big three stages.</p>

        <figcaption>The chair of SuTCO talks about community theatre.</i></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Sheffield also has a healthy relationship with student theatre of all stripes. The resident performing arts companies at the University of Sheffield, SuTCO and SUPAS, put on several productions per term, attracting healthy audiences of students and non-students alike to the Drama Studio and, occasionally, Theatre Delicatessen on the Moor.</p>

      <p>Nathan Spencer, the current chair of SuTCO, thinks that community outreach is a vital part of the work they do. </p>

      <p>"We often try to reach out to schools to broaden our audience," he says, "When we did the Great Gatsby, we had a group of schoolkids to come down to watch because they were doing it for their A-level."</p>

      <p>"The drama studio is a place that's incredibly special to a lot of people," he says, "It's renowned across Sheffield. The first time I ever went in there, I got shivers. It's vital to make sure as many people as possible get that opportunity." </p>

        "The first time I stepped into the drama studio, I got shivers."

        <span>Nathan Spencer</span>
      </div>

      <p>Nathan thinks we're in danger of being priced out of quality theatre, saying; "The theatre's always been a special thing. Live for 5 and group discounts are great, but certain forms of theatre have become inaccessible, just like some concerts and cinemas have."</p>

      <p>Alternative venue productions are a key part of SuTCO's outreach efforts, including at Theatre Delicatessen. Based on the old Woolworths building on Sheffield’s historic high street, <a href="http://theatredelicatessen.co.uk/" target="blank">Theatre Deli is a nexus</a> of many disparate and experimental theatre companies. There's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the city.</p>

      <h3><div></div> IV: Celebation</h3>

      <div class="pull animate">
        "Peoples' theatres are overturning the old stereotypes."
        <hr>
      </div>

      <p>Theatre can have a substantial connection with the communities surrounding it. It is not all tried-and-tested stories, enjoyed only by the elite in society and children in English Literature classes. Peoples' theatres and alternative venues are overturning the old stereotypes; creating a slow democratisation of the theatre.</p>

      <p>It's worth considering whether large theatre organisations are truly still serving the taxpayers who subsidise them. As government grants continue to dry up, at least for the immediate future, it's worth their while to consider how best to reach out to their audiences and, as Slung Low puts it, figure out "why we should be funded at all".</p>
